# Detection of Osteoporosis in Knees Using X-Ray Images and Lifestyle Analysis
This project aims to detect osteoporosis in knee joints through a dual approach that combines X-ray image analysis with lifestyle assessment, with a particular focus on gender-based variations. Osteoporosis is a condition that leads to weakened bones, increasing the risk of fractures, making early detection essential for effective management. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this approach integrates radiographic data with key lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and medical history to improve diagnostic accuracy.

A significant aspect of this study is its gender-specific analysis, recognizing the distinct physiological and lifestyle-related factors influencing bone health in men and women. By developing tailored detection models, this method provides personalized insights, enabling early intervention and customized treatment strategies. This comprehensive approach enhances osteoporosis detection and contributes to better patient care and management.
